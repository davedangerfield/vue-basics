## My Vue Background

[Evan You](https://www.linkedin.com/in/evanyou/) did a talk at IBM **Reactivity in Frontend Javascript Frameworks**

I started using it in May, 2017 and have built a couple sites.

I attended these frontend masters workshops in person:

* July 2017: [Intro to Vue.js](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/vue/) by [Sarah Drasner](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarahdrasner/)
* Sept. 2017: [Advanced Vue.js Features from the Ground Up](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/advanced-vue/) by Evan You

I've also watched a lot of [this](https://www.udemy.com/vuejs-2-the-complete-guide/learn/v4/overview) excellent Udemy course
